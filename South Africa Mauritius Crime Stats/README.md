Here is a workbook in `.xlsx` format containing charts that I put together of the crime over several categories from the last 12 years. I feel that these categories give a overall sense of the crime rates when comparing South Africa and Mauritius. 

Each crime category that I have chosen, namely, **Rape**, **Murder**, **Assault (GBH)**, **Common Assault**, **Drunk Driving** and **Burglary** has a chart showing the rate of that crime category normalized for the population size of each year of the reported crime count. 
To normalize, I took the total count for the year, divided it by the population for that same year, then multiplied the result by 100 000 to get the rate per 100 000. This is a common convention for countries to compare crime statistics while taking into account different population sizes.

Something that isn't really captured by this that could be an additional factor is population density, i.e. a large township in South Africa will have people more densely packed than a different area even if the other area has a lower population size, it may be that the one with higher population density has the most crime. This is just something to keep in mind when comparing crime inter and intra nation.

I got the statistics for each year of each crime category that I have covered here from the official population statistics by the government of each country which can be found here. 
- Mauritius population and crime statistics: https://statsmauritius.govmu.org/
- South African population statistics: https://www.statssa.gov.za/
- South African crime statistics: https://www.saps.gov.za/services/crimestats.php
The Mauritian population and crime statistics are provided in multiple, separate spreadsheets and documents. These were compiled into the workbook.

However, rate alone does not give a full picture – it is useful to see the raw numbers. For this reason I have included the total count of each category and some may find it useful.

I have used the statistics of the Republic of Mauritius which consists of the island of Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Agalega. The stats are presented mostly for the Republic, and the influence of the crime stats of Rodrigues and Agalega are minimal (sometimes almost negligible).

Some stats were simply not available for all the years that I would have liked such as hijacking, In this case I have only used the four years that were available from the Mauritius government and compared it to the corresponding four years of South Africa’s statistics.

Mauritius and South Africa don't always use the same legal terms for the same crimes. I have chosen to use the South African terms for the headings of the sheets and graphs. However, care was taken to make sure that they match up. For example, the two main Assault categories that we have in South Africa are:  **Assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm (GBH)** and **Common Assault**. Whereas Mauritius has **Serious Assault** and **Simple Assault**, but if you look at the breakdown of crimes that fit in the categories they seem to match the categories of South Africa.

At the end of the workbook is a chart showing the general trend year on year of the rate of each crime category for the last 12 years. 

For the drunk driving and common assault category, while Mauritius has more than double South Africa, it is possible that South Africa experiences more underreporting and that the Mauritius police does a better job of following through on reported crime.
